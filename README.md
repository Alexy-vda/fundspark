# FundSpark - A School Project

Welcome to the repository for FundSpark, a fictional crowdfunding platform. This project was created as part of a school assignment and serves as a demonstration of a functional, component-driven web application.

## Overview

FundSpark is a platform that connects innovative project creators with those who wish to support them. Though fictional, the platform is designed to mimic real-world functionality as closely as possible, with features including user registration, project creation and backing, and more.

## Tech Stack

This project has been developed using a modern tech stack including:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for building the user interface.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for creating reusable UI components.
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for backend services such as authentication and database management.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for developing UI components in isolation.

## Note

Please note that this is a school project and is not intended for real-world use. It is a learning tool designed to demonstrate the capabilities of the above technologies and to provide a hands-on understanding of modern web application development.
